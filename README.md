# Visualizing vector fields over manifold meshes

## Overview
Visualize vector fields from [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/GloballyOptimalDirectionFields/), with added alignment adapted from [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/TrivialConnections/).

(expand on the overview soon)

## Build Instructions
### Dependencies
`suitesparse`, `metis`, `blas`, `lapack`
should be available at the default paths (`/usr/local/`)

### Building
Run the following command from the project root directory:
```
sh build.sh
```
This builds fieldgen and tcods, as well as polyscope with fieldviz.
```
cd build
```

## Usage
(to be added)
